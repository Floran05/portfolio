                            Hi ! My name is Floran, and I'm a video game developer, currently studying for a master's degree at <a href="https://gamingcampus.fr/" class="description-link">Gaming Campus</a>.
                            My academic background is rooter in computer science, and I already hold a first master's degree in this field. Before diving into the world of video games, 
                            I worked for two years as a engineer in the <a class="description-link" href="https://www.femto-st.fr/fr/Departements-de-recherche/DISC/Presentation">Femto-ST</a> laboratory, 
                            where I contributed to the development of an educational application, <a href="https://ai-vt.univ-fcomte.fr/html/description.html" class="description-link">AI-VT (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Trainer)</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Computing and video games are my two great hobbies, and today I'm merging them to make my profession. It's this vision that led me to join Gaming Campus, where I'm doing an apprenticeship in 
                            "Video Game Development, Real-Time 3D Rendering and Immersive Technologies".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the beginning of 2024, I've also been working on a new personal project: creating my own video game. This game, developed with Unreal Engine, is characterized by its highly cooperative
                            aspect and its intrigues around labyrinths and multiverses.
                        </p>                        
                        <p>
                            If you have any questions, comments or advices, I'd be delighted to discuss them with you ! So don't hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="description-link">contact me</a> !

                                    I asked myself this question at the beginning of 2024, realizing that working in video games was really what I wanted to do most. But I'd never had the ambition to do it as a solo developer.

                                    It will be a highly cooperative multiplayer Action RPG, in which players will have to use each other's skills to escape from a labyrinth. With the help of a mysterious purple energy, 
                                    players will be able to travel through several multiverses to find elements that will enable them to progress towards the exit.

                                    After a motorhome roadtrip in Switzerland, from which I came back with complete SD cards of drone shots with incredible landscapes, I wanted to create an animation that showed the route traveled 
                                    as well as points of interest. So I used the Cesium extension for Unreal Engine, to display Switzerland in 3D in the engine. I then exported the route data from Google Maps and imported it into 
                                    Unreal Engine. Finally, I took a 3D motorhome model and modified it to look as similar as possible to our own. I then assembled all these elements into a video that recreates what we did each day.

                                    As you'll read below in the sesion describing <a class="description-link" href="#hobbies-drone">my hobbies</a>, I'm a FPV drone pilot. This discipline has on drawback: 
                                    a small piloting error can lead to a drone crash, and potentially high repair costs. One way of avoiding such errors is to train on a simulator, but simulators also often 
                                    have a drawback, which is the fidelity of physics to reality, and more specifically the effect of gravity. In most simulators, when you let the drone fall 
                                    (it's common to have to put the throttle to minimum), it loses altitude much more slowly than in real-life conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This problem made me want to test for myself and create a prototype drone flight model on Unreal Engine, to understant how the physics engine works and, by extension, 
                                    why most simulators suffer from this inaccuracy compared to reality.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The answer (at least in the case of Unreal Engine), is a coefficient used to simulate air friction during the fall. This method provides an approximation, but the result 
                                    is still a long way from reality, at least in the context of drone piloting, which requires enormous precision.

                                    Just before Epic Games released Fortnite, one of their teams was working on a third-person MOBA called Paragon. Available in early access, I started playing (it's too hard 
                                    to start League of Legends this late, there are too many champions to learn !) and quickly got hoocked: it has great art direction, incredible character design 
                                    and thirs-person gameplay that's far more immersive thant the isometric view of Riot Games' MOBA.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, shortly after Fortnite was released, Epic Games annonced that development of Paragon would not be continuing. Aware of the work they were abandoning, 
                                    the studio made many of the assets used in the game freely available on the Unreal Engine marketplace.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Saddened by this news, I decided to redevelop the game so that I could continue playing with friends. This project enabled me to discover Unreal Engine and learn how 
                                    game creation on this engine works. After three years of inching forward, I finally gave up on this project, which wasn't really mine after all, but which nevertheless 
                                    enabled me to learn an enormous amount.

                                    I created my first game during my 3<sup>rd</sup> year of my Bachelor's degree. As part of a two-person team, we had to create a 2D game using the

                                    With a friend who's a car and rally fan as a teammate, we created a game in wich the player has to steer his car using the mouse cursor to cross 
                                    as many stages as possible in as little time as possible, without going off the road.

                            <h3>AI-based skills identification system</h3>
                            <div class="text">
                                <p>
                                    During my last year of master's degree, I had the chance to carry out an internship in the FEMTO-ST laboratory, with a project in the field 
                                    of artificial intelligence, an area that seemed so complex that i tought it inaccessible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The objective of this project was to carry out an application module capable of identifying the skills that a student masters, by analizing 
                                    an evaluation exercise. This module was intended to be integrated into a course revisions application, on which I was able to work, and which 
                                    I detail in the next tile.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So I discovered the Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI techniques, with in particular the multilabel classification technique, which I used 
                                    in this project. This technique consists in teaching artificial intelligence how to associate elements of a text with a label, so that it 
                                    is later, capable of carrying out the reverse : identifying all labels in a new text.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In our case, the labels represented the skills to be identified and we were able to train AI for algorithmic and english. Thus, the skills 
                                    could be on the one hand, "knowing how to write a conditional structure", and on the other, "knowing how to use -ing verbs".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This AI can therefore, in theory, apply to any subject, taking into account that it still takes a minimum amount of data to train it. This 
                                    notion posed us problem during the project, because it is more difficult to obtain correct results with an AI trained on a very poor dataset.
                                </p>

                            <div class="text">
                                <p>
                                    Following the final year of my Master's project, the FEMTO-ST laboratory offered me the chance to continue the project for a further two years.
                                    I took part in the development of the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Trainer (AI-VT) application, which already existed when I arrived. Based
                                    on a case-based reasoning system, it enables students to revise their courses by generating a personalized list of execises for each revision session. 
                                    In the version I worked on, personalization was enabled by the teacher, who had to mark each exercise completed by each student. In this way, the system 
                                    was able to identify the student's progress and propose a progression in the exercises.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My first task was to integrate the module created during the internship into the application. The aim of this module was to create a profile of a student 
                                    using the application for the first time, identifying the skills he still needs to work on, so that he could have a personalized experience right from the 
                                    first revision exercises.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I subsequently redeveloped and modernized the application, originally coded in PHP in 2014, rewriting it in Javascript with NodeJS and improving the 
                                    interfaces to make them more up-to-date.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A new player was later added to the project : a humanoid robot, Nao. The aim was to make revision sessions more dynamic by adding interaction between the 
                                    student and the robot. I was in charge of interfacing the application with Nao to enable ergonomic control of the robot, but also to enable it to react
                                    automatically during a revision session.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whereas the classic revision system could be used by any type of user, the sessions with Nao were aimed at a younger audience. We had the opportunity to 
                                    carry out an experiment in a nursery school, to make pupils revise English lessons. For example, Nao could ask what color his eyes were, or show him a card 
                                    with a certain number written on it (the robot identified the cards using a QR code).
                                </p>

                                    For my 3<sup>rd</sup> year Bachelor's degree internship in the Chrono-environnement laboratory, the project concerned data on cholera in the 
                                    Democratic Republic of Congo. The aim was to create an application that would enable scientists to format their data easily and in different formats,
                                    and to generate PDF reports of the conclusions they could draw from it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The application was built as a web application with a server side in PHP, and its primary aim was to offer its features in an ergonomic and simple 
                                    way, so that it could be used by people who are not specialists in computer sciences. This meant that data could be imported and displayed in the 
                                    form of tables, graphs or maps. Once the scientist had filtered the data he wished to highlight, he could add the table, graph or map to a report 
                                    and add his comments, finally exporting the report as a PDF.

                                    Towards the end of the project, the application was deployed on a laboratory server for internal access.

                                    Initially, I suggested to a member of my family, who owns an industrial maintenance company, that I create an application that would help him 
                                    save time on administrative tasks, and in particular with his invoicing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With his very own way of doing things, I created this web application (NodeJS), adapting it to his needs, while suggesting possible improvements 
                                    that he wouldn't necessarily be aware of, such as using speech-to-text to fill in certain information by speaking, rather than having to write 
                                    everthing on a keyboard.

                                    Today, I maintain this application and regularly add various features to help him in his work, with, for example, recently, a system that allows 
                                    him to list his equipment and identify where it is stored.

                                    Having always been fascinated by anything that flies, be it aviation or space, but also birds, I jumped at the chance to become a drone pilot 
                                    when these little flying machines became fairly reliable and accessible. Unfortunately, this discipline quickly become less accessible when 
                                    a little piloting error can lead to quite unpeasant repair costs !
                                </p>

                                    So I've been an amateur pilot for <span id="drone-years">5</span> years, mainly in the disciplines of freestyle and cinematic. I regularly post 
                                    videos of my flights on Instagram, which you can find just below.

                                    I think if you've read the previous sections, you'll have understood that I love video games ! But I still wanted to share my gamer profile !
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In fact, there are so many masterpieces out there that it's hard to make a selection !
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For my solo gamer side, I often go for action RPGs. I appreciate the difficulty, but the visual and narrative experience comes first. I'm thinking 
                                    in particular of the wonderful Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the Horizon license, or the awesome Elden Ring.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for cooperative games, ARK: Survival Evolved is the game I've played most in my Steam library, and I also rank Destiny 2 very highly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for competitive games, my current favorites would be PUBG, Apex Legens and Valorant.

                                    Whereas League of Legends uses a system of items store, which players can purchase as the game proggresses, Paragon is based 
                                    on a card deck system. In order to adapt to different team compositions, players must first build several decks. During this 
                                    process, you need to equip gems (left side of the interface) and cards (central part of the interface). Gems and cards have 
                                    characteristics that influence the character's stats, or offer passives. Cards can also provide an active skill. They all have 
                                    an affinity that defines their play style (e.g. Chaos (Wold) &rArr; damage, Growth (Flower) &rArr; defense), and a deck can 
                                    only contain cards of two different affinities.

                                    Once players have earned 1000 coins during the game, they can spend them on an attribute point (Agility, Vitality or Intellect).
                                    When the player has enough attribute points (the cost is indicated in the top right corner of each card), he can equip a 
                                    card in one of the three solts.
