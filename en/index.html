                            Hi ! My name is Floran, and I'm a video game developer, currently studying for a master's degree at <a href="https://gamingcampus.fr/" class="description-link">Gaming Campus</a>.
                            My academic background is rooter in computer science, and I already hold a first master's degree in this field. Before diving into the world of video games, 
                            I worked for two years as a engineer in the <a class="description-link" href="https://www.femto-st.fr/fr/Departements-de-recherche/DISC/Presentation">Femto-ST</a> laboratory, 
                            where I contributed to the development of an educational application, <a href="https://ai-vt.univ-fcomte.fr/html/description.html" class="description-link">AI-VT (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Trainer)</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Computing and video games are my two great hobbies, and today I'm merging them to make my profession. It's this vision that led me to join Gaming Campus, where I'm doing an apprenticeship in 
                            "Video Game Development, Real-Time 3D Rendering and Immersive Technologies".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the beginning of 2024, I've also been working on a new personal project: creating my own video game. This game, developed with Unreal Engine, is characterized by its highly cooperative
                            aspect and its intrigues around labyrinths and multiverses.
                        </p>                        
                        <p>
                            If you have any questions, comments or advices, I'd be delighted to discuss them with you ! So don't hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="description-link">contact me</a> !

                                    I asked myself this question at the beginning of 2024, realizing that working in video games was really what I wanted to do most. But I'd never had the ambition to do it as a solo developer.

                                    So I set out on the journey of creating my first video game with Unreal Engine !

                                    It will be a highly cooperative multiplayer Action RPG, in which players will have to use each other's skills to escape from a labyrinth. With the help of a mysterious purple energy, 
                                    players will be able to travel through several multiverses to find elements that will enable them to progress towards the exit.

                                    After a motorhome roadtrip in Switzerland, from which I came back with complete SD cards of drone shots with incredible landscapes, I wanted to create an animation that showed the route traveled 
                                    as well as points of interest. So I used the Cesium extension for Unreal Engine, to display Switzerland in 3D in the engine. I then exported the route data from Google Maps and imported it into 
                                    Unreal Engine. Finally, I took a 3D motorhome model and modified it to look as similar as possible to our own. I then assembled all these elements into a video that recreates what we did each day.

                                    As you'll read below in the sesion describing <a class="description-link" href="#hobbies-drone">my hobbies</a>, I'm a FPV drone pilot. This discipline has on drawback: 
                                    a small piloting error can lead to a drone crash, and potentially high repair costs. One way of avoiding such errors is to train on a simulator, but simulators also often 
                                    have a drawback, which is the fidelity of physics to reality, and more specifically the effect of gravity. In most simulators, when you let the drone fall 
                                    (it's common to have to put the throttle to minimum), it loses altitude much more slowly than in real-life conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This problem made me want to test for myself and create a prototype drone flight model on Unreal Engine, to understant how the physics engine works and, by extension, 
                                    why most simulators suffer from this inaccuracy compared to reality.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The answer (at least in the case of Unreal Engine), is a coefficient used to simulate air friction during the fall. This method provides an approximation, but the result 
                                    is still a long way from reality, at least in the context of drone piloting, which requires enormous precision.

                                    Just before Epic Games released Fortnite, one of their teams was working on a third-person MOBA called Paragon. Available in early access, I started playing (it's too hard 
                                    to start League of Legends this late, there are too many champions to learn !) and quickly got hoocked: it has great art direction, incredible character design 
                                    and thirs-person gameplay that's far more immersive thant the isometric view of Riot Games' MOBA.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, shortly after Fortnite was released, Epic Games annonced that development of Paragon would not be continuing. Aware of the work they were abandoning, 
                                    the studio made many of the assets used in the game freely available on the Unreal Engine marketplace.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Saddened by this news, I decided to redevelop the game so that I could continue playing with friends. This project enabled me to discover Unreal Engine and learn how 
                                    game creation on this engine works. After three years of inching forward, I finally gave up on this project, which wasn't really mine after all, but which nevertheless 
                                    enabled me to learn an enormous amount.

                                    Having always been fascinated by anything that flies, be it aviation or space, but also birds, I jumped at the chance to become a drone pilot 
                                    when these little flying machines became fairly reliable and accessible. Unfortunately, this discipline quickly become less accessible when 
                                    a little piloting error can lead to quite unpeasant repair costs !
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So I've been an amateur pilot for <span id="drone-years">5</span> years, mainly in the disciplines of freestyle and cinematic. I regularly post 
                                    videos of my flights on Instagram, which you can find just below.

                                    For those unfamiliar with this discipline, I suggest you take a look at this page, which briefly summarize how it works :

                                    I think if you've read the previous sections, you'll have understood that I love video games ! But I still wanted to share my gamer profile !
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In fact, there are so many masterpieces out there that it's hard to make a selection !
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For my solo gamer side, I often go for action RPGs. I appreciate the difficulty, but the visual and narrative experience comes first. I'm thinking 
                                    in particular of the wonderful Kena: Bridge of Spirits, the Horizon license, or the awesome Elden Ring.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for cooperative games, ARK: Survival Evolved is the game I've played most in my Steam library, and I also rank Destiny 2 very highly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for competitive games, my current favorites would be PUBG, Apex Legens and Valorant.

                                    Whereas League of Legends uses a system of items store, which players can purchase as the game proggresses, Paragon is based 
                                    on a card deck system. In order to adapt to different team compositions, players must first build several decks. During this 
                                    process, you need to equip gems (left side of the interface) and cards (central part of the interface). Gems and cards have 
                                    characteristics that influence the character's stats, or offer passives. Cards can also provide an active skill. They all have 
                                    an affinity that defines their play style (e.g. Chaos (Wold) &rArr; damage, Growth (Flower) &rArr; defense), and a deck can 
                                    only contain cards of two different affinities.

                                    Once players have earned 1000 coins during the game, they can spend them on an attribute point (Agility, Vitality or Intellect).
                                    When the player has enough attribute points (the cost is indicated in the top right corner of each card), he can equip a 
                                    card in one of the three solts.

                                    Players can move discreetly around the map to surprise their opponents. To do this, they need to stay out of direct line-of-sight 
                                    with an opposing player. If an opponent is spotted, the whole team is informed of his position.

                                    A quick communication system allows players to transmit essential information to the whole team without having to write a message 
                                    in the chat. The system also allows you to send a message that will be automatically translated into the language of the other players.
